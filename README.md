# Bank Churn Model

## Objectives

- **Customer Retention:** The primary objective of a churn prediction model is to help banks retain valuable customers. By identifying customers at risk of churning, the bank can take proactive steps to retain them, such as offering incentives, personalized offers, or improved customer service.

- **Revenue Protection:** Churn can lead to a loss of revenue for the bank. The model helps the bank in preventing this loss by targeting high-value customers who are at risk of churning and taking measures to retain them.

- **Customized Marketing and Offers:** Churn prediction models enable banks to create personalized marketing campaigns and offers for customers who are likely to leave. This can include tailored promotions, loyalty rewards, or other incentives to encourage them to stay.

- **Risk Management:** Identifying customers at risk of churning also helps in risk management. Banks can assess the potential impact of losing specific customers and take actions to mitigate these risks.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Churn prediction models promote data-driven decision-making within the bank. They provide actionable insights that can inform strategies for customer retention and business growth.

## Bank Churn Modeling

This Python script analyzes a dataset on bank churn modeling using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The dataset contains information about bank customers and whether they churned or not.

### Analysis

- Import the dataset from the provided URL.
- Perform data analysis using Pandas methods such as `info()`, `head()`, and `describe()`.
- Replace categorical variables with numerical labels for 'Geography', 'Gender', and 'Num Of Products'.
- Analyze the distribution of categorical variables and create a new feature 'Zer Balance' based on customer balance.
- Visualize the distribution of churn using Seaborn's `countplot()`.

### Preprocessing

- Define features (X) and labels (y) for modeling.
- Perform Random Under Sampling using `RandomUnderSampler` from the `imblearn` library to balance the dataset.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The script will download the dataset from the provided URL and perform data analysis and preprocessing.
4. Visualizations will be displayed to analyze the distribution of churn.
5. The balanced dataset after Random Under Sampling will be used for further analysis or modeling.
